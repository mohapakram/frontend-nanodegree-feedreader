# Feedreader Testing  Projectt

In this project i wrote tests for web-based application that reads RSS feeds with  [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## How To Run The APP ?
Open `index.html` File In google-chrome.

happy testing :)
